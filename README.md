# Sorting Visualizer

This project is a sorting visualizer that allows users to interactively visualize the sorting process of various algorithms. The web application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Files and Directory Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file containing the structure of the web page.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling the web page.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file containing the implementation of sorting algorithms and visualization functions.

## Usage

1. Click on "Randomize Array" to generate a random set of bars.
2. Click on "Change Size" to randomize the sizes of the bars.
3. Click on the sorting algorithm buttons to visualize the sorting process.

## Sorting Algorithms

The following sorting algorithms are implemented in the project:

- **Insertion Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
- **Merge Sort**
- **Shell Sort**

Feel free to explore and observe how each algorithm sorts the bars visually.
